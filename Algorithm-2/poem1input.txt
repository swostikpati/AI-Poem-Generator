you are what I
crave and desire
your company
eternal sun
your absence fire
you are my whole
lifeâ€™s craze the one
thing in my mind
love is no crime
the shirt of pain
I wore laid bare
the grief within
my wet cheeks aired
the love I hid
secrets undone
by tell-tale sobs
cure me of this
hard agony
you are its cause
and remedy
your healing hand
inflames the hurt
your bright eyes are
the gold I hoard
your rosy cheeks
assassins your
hair is my jail
the game is up
a martyrdom
of love is mine
death by sweet swords
how many fine
souls meet the same
sharp, tender blade
I will not stop
loving nor seek
relief love is
my law my drug
inside and out
happy the eyes
that looked at you
and won a look
returned now I
am burning lost
