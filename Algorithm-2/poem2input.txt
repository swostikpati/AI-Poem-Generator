how much longer must I face
this scorn this turning back
have I not wept enough
for how long will I suffer
your neglect savage as hunger
have you not had enough
be kind to me contempt is hard
to take master the time has come
to treat me better gentlemen
have mercy on my heart
all sleep and patience gone
is it the law of love
that I should be alone
while others love
oh lord let him be cruel
I am not done
