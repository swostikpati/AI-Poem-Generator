the
gold
i
hoard
your
rosy
cheeks
assassins
your
hair
is
my
jail
the
game
is
up
a
martyrdom
of
love
is
mine
death
by
sweet
swords
how
many
fine
souls
meet
the
same
sharp
tender
blade
i
will
not
stop
loving
nor
seek
relief
love
is
my
law
my
drug
inside
and
out
happy
the
eyes
that
looked
at
you
and
won
a
look
returned
now
i
am
burning
lostif
i
were
to
complain
what
would
i
say
or
tried
to
look
for
way
or
sent
a
messenger
to
tell
my
tale
who
could
translate
this
ache
if
i
attempted
forbearance
after
love
has
flown
nothing
but
regret
and
grief
and
tears
on
cheeks
you
now
far
from
sight
will
in
my
heart
remain
was
it
not
you
who
taught
me
how
to
love
and
all
my
life
from
oath
not
to
strayhow
much
longer
must
i
face
this
scorn
this
turning
back
have
i
not
wept
enough
for
how
long
will
i
suffer
your
neglect
savage
as
hunger
have
you
not
had
enough
be
kind
to
me
contempt
is
hard
to
take
master
the
time
has
come
to
treat
me
better
gentlemen
have
mercy
on
my
heart
all
sleep
and
patience
gone
is
it
the
law
of
love
that
i
should
be
alone
while
others
love
oh
lord
let
him
be
cruel
i
am
not
done
how
fine
is
the
forgiveness
of
the
strong
and
finer
when
it
falls
on
weaker
hearts
if
friendship
ever
was
a
sacred
bond
do
not
cast
off
the
first
friend
for
the
last
i
thought
you
were
the
shield
to
keep
me
safe
against
the
dart
you
were
the
spear
i
sought
your
help
in
danger
as
the
left
arm
seeks
the
right
now
stand
away
and
let
the
spearman
aim
for
if
you
must
disown
our
friendship
please
do
not
side
with
my
foeif
you
suffer
save
your
soul
leave
the
house
to
mourn
its
builder
nothing
lost
there
will
be
other
homes
no
second
you
do
not
entrust
your
mission
to
another
but
your
self
your
truest
friend
nothing
swells
the
neck
but
his
own
breath
his
best
defenseif
i
had
known
my
love
would
come
this
way
i
would
have
laid
a
mantle
of
my
blood
my
own
black
eyes
upon
the
street
and
tiled
the
earth
with
cheeks
and
made
an
avenue
of
eyelids
for
his
feetmy
fate
is
like
an
enemy
it
shows
me
only
hate
if
once
it
stoops
to
kindness
it
soon
mends
its
mistake
it
is
the
art
of
lovers
to
express
with
eyelids
what
their
lips
have
left
unsaid
a
glance
at
him
gives
me
the
news
i
missed
how
sweet
to
linger
on
his
face
what
heat
in
eyes
that
want
to
speak
beloved
lids
spell
out
a
note
for
loving
eyes
to
readpardon
this
may
be
cruel
or
kind
i
own
my
sins
each
one
its
time
you
showed
some
grace
all
those
who
seek
forgiveness
from
above

the

could

who
came
this
way
it
would
thrill
at
the

and
kiss
the
ground
as
if
to
greet
its
guest
as
if
to
say
well
met
and
welcome
to
a
gracious
mindlike

are
to
the
world
brightness
and
shade
no
flaw
his
round
black
heartin
love
you
made
me
stand
and
sat
to
rest
you
pricked
my
fretting
eyes
and
fell
asleep
and
left
me
with
your
ghost
and
my
regrets
to
brood
on
you
and
weep
you
swore
you
would
be
constant
to
the
end
but
when
you
had
my
heart
you
broke
the
vow
i
was
a
child
about
love
i
knew
nothing
i
am
learning
nowit
was
not
out
of
boredom
that
i
left
but
hard
necessity
she
wished
to
let
a
third
into
our
pair
i
fled
this
blasphemy
keep
your
secret
if
you
tell
it
you
have
lost
it
if
your
own
heart
cannot
hold
it
how
will
the
heart
you
gave
it
to
holdonly
true
souls
keep
a
secret
only
the
best
